# Wimax_Handover

This project details the simulation results of a seamless handover mechanism at 
[IEEE 802.16 (WiMax)](https://wimaxforum.org/). I performed these Opnet simulations as a part of my work as a research assistant at REMON - the Israeli 4G industry-academia  consortium. 

The project includes the final report and the presentation for this project.
